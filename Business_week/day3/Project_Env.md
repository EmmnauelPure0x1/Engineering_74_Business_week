### Agile 
The Agile Methodology is an approach in software development that focuses on iterations while emphasizing the rapid delivery of an application.
- The client can frequently be in contact with the developer to see the workâ€™s progress enabling them to make decisions and changes along the way if needed.
- This will make the product become more user focussed.
- Gives the client a sense of ownership.
- It also enables the product to be released with basic functionality.


- Common Practice:
It is not common practice for an organisation to switch methodologies.
If resources are available a company may choose to do so if beneficial.
Industries may use different methodolies.
